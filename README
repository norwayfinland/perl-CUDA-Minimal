CUDA-Minimal version 0.01
=========================

CUDA::Minimal is a minimal set of CUDA bindings for Perl.

CUDA is a great framework for writing parallel applications that run on
(capable) nVidia video cards. An important part of CUDA is the API for
transfering data to and from the video card. These bindings provide a
set of Perl-accessible functions that expose that API, allowing you,
the programmer, to focus on the important stuff: writing your CUDA
kernels.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

If you're on Windows, the ./ is not necessary.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires ExtUtils::nvcc. At the time of writing,
ExtUtils::nvcc is supposed to run on Windows using Visual c++, and on
Linux using gcc. However, not all is finished and in fact it is known
to work on Ubuntu 10.10, only. If you want to see CUDA::Minimal on your
favorite platform, please help improve ExtUtils::nvcc!

Furthermore, I believe this works with Perl 5.8.8. It may work with versions
lower than 5.8.8, but I cannout easily tell. At any rate, the module requires
5.8.8 to compile.
