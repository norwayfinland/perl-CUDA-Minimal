=head1 NAME

CUDA::Minimal::Tests - a collection of tests for CUDA::Minimal.

=head1 USAGE

This provides a couple of CUDA kernels used in the CUDA::Minimal test suite.
You probably won't have need for any of these, unless you want to take a look at
the XS code in Test.xs for an idea of how to wrap CUDA kernel calls.
